  what_is_sgc: What is Saigon Cup?
  sgc_is: |
    Born in 2014 with the mission to improve the Vietnamese fighting game
    scene, the Street Fighter Vietnam community based in Hồ Chí Minh City
    worked together to organize an international fighting game tournament right
    in Vietnam - a feat that no other domestic organizer managed to achieve.
    With 5 years of experience under our belt, Saigon Cup 2019 is endorsed by
    Capcom and SNK, being an official event in both Capcom Pro Tour and Neo Geo
    World Tour (King of Fighters).

  memorable: |
    Whether you're a fighting game lover or just a
    curious spectator wanting to learn more about the scene, Saigon Cup is the
    place to be.
